#HeaderTwo The French-Chickasaw Wars of 1736 & 1739

Two major military campaigns organized by the French against the Chickasaw nation during the 1730s forced hundreds of Africans 
and their descendants into colonial warfare. During the first French-Chickasaw war of 1736, the French colonial army included
over one hundred and fifty armed Africans and their descendents fighting alongside the French. A few years later during the second
French-Chickasaw war of 1739, no major battle occurred. However, Africans and their descendents labored in war convoys up and down
the Mississippi River, from New Orleans to present-day Memphis, Tennessee. They were instrumental in every step of the French effort,
from building the boats that would carry the artillery upriver to rowing the boats upstream to providing care for soldiers and other Africans based at the forts built for the war. 

**Africans and their descendents remain missing from accounts of the French-Chickasaw wars.** 

This site is a first step in recovering their stories and situating them in these major 18th century military campaigns 
that included people from over fifteen Native nations, from France and other parts of Europe, and a variety of African nations. 



As we see it, a minimal edition is one that aims to reduce the size and complexity of the back and
front end while flattening the learning curves for the user and the producer. Out of the box, the Ed
theme can help you build a simple reading edition, or a traditional scholarly edition with footnotes
and a bibliography, without breaking the bank. In our estimate, these are the two most immediately
useful type of editions for editors and readers. An edition produced with Ed consists of static
pages whose rate of decay is substantially lower than database-driven systems. As an added bonus,
these static pages require less bandwidth. Our hope is that our approach can help beginners and
veterans deploy beautiful editions with less effort, and that it can help us teach a 'full stack'
[in one academic semester](https://github.com/susannalles/MinimalEditions/blob/master/README.md),
while allowing us to care for our projects at less cost, and perhaps, just perhaps, to generate
high-quality editions on github.io in large quantities based on the
[git-lit](http://jonreeve.com/2015/09/introducing-git-lit/) model by Jonathan Reeve. We're coming
for you, Kindle!

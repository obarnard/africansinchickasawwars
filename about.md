## The French-Chickasaw Wars of 1736 & 1739

Two major military campaigns organized by the French against the Chickasaw nation during the 1730s forced hundreds of Africans 
and their descendants into colonial warfare. During the first French-Chickasaw war of 1736, the French colonial army included
over one hundred and fifty armed Africans and their descendents fighting alongside the French. A few years later during the second
French-Chickasaw war of 1739, no major battle occurred. However, Africans and their descendents labored in war convoys up and down
the Mississippi River, from New Orleans to present-day Memphis, Tennessee. They were instrumental in every step of the French effort,
from building the boats that would carry the artillery upriver to rowing the boats upstream to providing care for each other and anyone else stationed at the forts built for the war. 

**Africans and their descendents remain missing from accounts of the French-Chickasaw wars.** 

This site is a first step in recovering their stories and situating them in these major 18th century military campaigns 
that included people from over fifteen Native nations, from France and other parts of Europe, and a variety of African nations.
